		Air your Music and Audio files to promote and sell them.
		<br/><br/>
		Toadsquare makes it simple for you to present your work in its best light.  Upload your files to your Showcase and people can listen to your creative output and learn more about the back story and development path.
		<br/><br/>
		Use the Oneline Description to introduce the project. If you want to engage people at a deeper level, you have up to 600 words in Further Description, plus the facility to add a Sample audio snippet or entire piece to enhance overall presentation.
		<br/><br/>
		Our site gives you feedback through Reviews, Craves and Ratings. If a member craves your work they will automatically be notified about similar work you do and Upcoming projects or events you put up. If your project features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		It’s also the place to start earning some extra money. Music & Audio allows you to publish and distribute your own work. If you choose to sell your work, you can entice listeners by allowing a 20-second Preview of each piece.  You can choose how you want to deliver your work: via Download or as a shipped Product. If you don’t want to sell your files, you can ask people to Donate to show their appreciation.
		<br/><br/>
		To get started: select a Media tool and decide how much space your project will need. You get 50 MB of free space, but some projects will need more.  You can always add extra space to a project from your Dashboard. 
		<br/><br/>
		Next, fill in the Music & Audio New Project Wizard and save. There is a lot of information you can add here, but you can do so in stages. You only have to fill in the basic information on the Description Page to first save the project. 
		<br/><br/>
		After saving the project, you can add details until you are satisfied with how your work looks in Preview before you publish it. Once your project is published on your Showcase, you can edit it, and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button.
		<br/><br/>
		You can invite members you have included in Key Personnel to Show the project or piece on their own Showcases. Putting a link to your work on other members’ Showcases gives fans and casual visitors more of an opportunity to find your work.
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your work using the Email and Share functions.  If you know of other media projects on Toadsquare associated with yours, you can connect to them in Supporting Media and in PR Material you can add links to News, Reviews and Interviews. 
		<br/><br/> 
		Go on! See how many people will crave your work…
