		Sell and promote your Educational Material.
		<br/><br/>
		Here you can help others fulfil their creative potential by putting up free lessons and classroom-ready activities. Or you can earn some extra money by teaching others a creative skill, a specialist technique or a piece of technical know-how.
		<br/><br/>
		Educational Material allows you to publish and distribute your own work. Choose how you want to deliver your lessons: via Download or as a shipped Product. You could put together a package – video, audio file and/or written material.  If you don’t want to sell your lessons you can ask people to Donate in appreciation of them. 
		<br/><br/>
		Our site gives you feedback on your lessons through Reviews, Craves and Ratings. If a member craves your work they will automatically be notified about similar work and Upcoming projects or events you put up. If your project features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		Your Oneline Description will draw in people who want to expand their skill set. You have 600 words to use in Further Description to explain the content and scope of your lesson, plus you can add an Extract of sample material to help convince them yours is the right class to take.  
		<br/><br/>
		To get started: select a Media tool and decide how much space your project will need. You get 50 MB of free space, but some projects will need more. You can always add extra space to a project from your Dashboard. 
		<br/><br/>
		Next, fill in the Educational Material New Project Wizard and save. There is a lot of information you can add here, but you can do so in stages. You only have to fill in the basic information on the Description Page to first save the project. 
		<br/><br/>
		After saving the project, you can add details until you are satisfied with how your work looks in Preview before you publish it. Once your project is published on your Showcase, you can edit it and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button.
		<br/><br/>
		You can invite members you have included in Key Personnel to Show a project or a lesson on their own Showcases. Putting a link to your work on other members’ Showcases gives fans and casual visitors more of an opportunity to find your work. 
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your work using the Email and Share functions. If you know of other media projects on Toadsquare associated with yours, you can connect to them in Supporting Media and in PR Material you can add links to News, Reviews and Interviews. 
		<br/><br/>
		Go on! See how many people will take your lessons…
