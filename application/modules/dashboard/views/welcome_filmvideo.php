		Promote and sell your Films and Videos in a stunning online gallery.
		<br/><br/>
		Toadsquare makes it simple for you to present your work in its best light. Upload a film project to your Showcase and people will be able to experience the fruits of your creative labour as well as learn more about its back story and development path.
		<br/><br/>
		Use the Oneline Description to introduce the project. If you want to engage people at a deeper level, you have up to 600 words in Further Description, plus the facility to add an Extract and two Trailers to enhance presentation.
		<br/><br/>
		Our site gives you feedback through Reviews, Craves and Ratings. If a member craves your work they will automatically be notified about similar work you do and Upcoming projects or events you put up. If your project features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		It’s also the place to start earning some extra money. Film & Video allows you to publish and distribute your own work. You can choose how you want to deliver your work: via Download, Pay Per View or as a shipped Product. Even if you don’t want to sell your work, you can ask people to Donate to show appreciation of it.
		<br/><br/>
		To get started: select a Media tool and decide how much space your project will need. You get 50 MB of free space, but some projects will need more.  You can always add extra space to a project from your Dashboard. 
		<br/><br/>
		Next, fill in the Film & Video New Project Wizard and save. There is a lot of information you can add here, but you can do so in stages.  You only have to fill in the basic information on the Description Page to first save the project. An important decision to make is whether you are putting up a Collection or a Major Work.  A Collection is up to 20 pieces whereas a Major Work showcases one piece. 
		<br/><br/>
		After saving the project, you can add details until you are satisfied with how your work looks in Preview before you publish. Once your project is published on your Showcase, you can edit it and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button.
		<br/><br/>
		You can invite members you have included in Key Cast & Crew to Show the project or a piece on their own Showcases. Putting a link to your work on other members’ Showcases gives fans and casual visitors more of an opportunity to find your work. 
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your work using the Email and Share functions. If you know of other media projects on Toadsquare associated with yours, you can connect to them in Supporting Media and in PR Material you can add links to News, Reviews and Interviews. 
		<br/><br/>
		Go on! See how many people will crave your work…
