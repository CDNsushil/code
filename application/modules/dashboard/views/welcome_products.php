		Look out for treasure in our marketplace for creative products.
		<br/><br/>
		Toadsquare promotes creative camaraderie, from sharing artistic ideas right down to the practical pooling of equipment and resources. An item you might consider beyond its use-by date, someone else might covet as a jewel. And vice versa.
		<br/><br/>
		Sitting in a cupboard you have an old film enlarger, a 1920s dress that could be great for a theatrical costume wardrobe, and a video camera you no longer use because you have recently upgraded. These items are valuable only in their creative settings.
		<br/><br/>
		Toadsquare has a win-win solution for clearing out that cupboard. Here you can advertise and sell the products you no longer use. Alternatively, if you are hunting for a particular item or model, you can alert people as to how much you’re willing to pay for that niche product.
		<br/><br/>
		Here’s how: first, buy your Product tool, fill in the short forms in the administration section and advertise. Before you put up your advert, check it out in Preview. If you put up a Product For Sale classified, make sure it looks as attractive as possible. If you put up a Product Wanted classified, try to be clear and specific so you don’t get offers of products you don’t want. Remember to publicise your advert using the Email and Share functions.
		<br/><br/>
		Sit back and see how many Craves you get. In this section Craves work like a reminder list, letting people create a record or wish-list of what they would like to buy or of what they too could sell. If your classified features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		The Free Product tool is free. So share a great site by putting up it’s URL and make someone’s day!
