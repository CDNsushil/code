		Stir up pre-launch publicity and excitement about your work.
		<br/><br/>
		Do you have a media project or event in development that you want to build up anticipation for? Here, you can publish snippets and teasers of your Advertise - with or without supporting PR material. Use this facility to spread the word within your market and expose your creative talents to a wider audience.
		<br/><br/>
		As people follow your work’s evolution they can Donate to its development, financially and creatively. You can get feedback on your work through Craves and Ratings. If a member craves your work they will automatically be notified about your next Advertise.
		<br/><br/>
		To get started: select an Advertise tool and decide how much space your project will need. You get 50 MB of free space, but some projects will need more.  You can always add extra space to a project from your Dashboard. 
		<br/><br/>
		Next, fill in the Advertise Wizard and save. There is a lot of information you can add here, but you can do so in stages.  You only have to fill in the basic information on the Description Page to first save the project. 
		<br/><br/>
		After saving the project, you can add details until you are satisfied with how your work looks in Preview before you publish it. Once your project is published on your Showcase, you can edit it and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button.
		<br/><br/>
		You can invite members you have included in Key Personnel to Show a project on their own Showcases. Putting a link to your work on others members’ Showcases gives fans and casual viewers more of an opportunity to find your work. 
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your work: add associated News and Interviews in PR Material and tell people about your project using the Email and Share functions.
		<br/><br/>
		Go on! See how many people will crave your work…
