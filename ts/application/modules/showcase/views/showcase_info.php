		<div class="font_arial font_size14 clr_white lineH20">To Showcase yourself you first need to fill some details and publish your homepage.  You have to publish this section before you can use the other features in the showcase; such as, promote your media or create a blog.
		<div class="seprator_20"></div>
		You can start with some basic, required information (remeber to save) and then add more as you you wish, now or later. Once you publish your homepage people will be able to find you through our search and search engines can start finding you. So our tip is: the more effort you put into your homepage; such as, updating the default image and filling in the About Me section, the better youâ€™ll look online.

		After you have published your homepage you may want to go and check out your dashboard and see what else you have available in your free membership or read some of our <a href="javascript:viod(0)" class=" clr_white bdr_f1592a"> tips pages.</a>
