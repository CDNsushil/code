		As an artist, you need to get out there, promote yourself and meet your fans. 
		Toadsquare helps make this process of engagement run as smoothly as possible while giving your event a dynamic and attractive appeal.
		<br/><br/>
		First, buy your Launch, Event or Event with Launch tool and start by signposting your event. Provide as much venue and contact information as possible. Remember that even though you are promoting your event to the world, the Toadsquare search will allow people in your neighbourhood to find you and help steer them to the door.
		<br/><br/>
		Consider what you want to charge. Do you want to offer free tickets, an early bird discount or a straight ticket price? You can set a price for up to three ticket categories. For an event, you can mix and match your ticket offer for different venues and for up to 20 sessions.
		<br/><br/>
		Once you’ve made these foundation decisions, you can set about creating the buzz. The aim is to make it an event people won’t want to miss. You can put up associated News, Reviews, Interviews and Promotional Images. You have up to 600 words in Further Description to sell your event.  If you have further promotional material, you can add extra space to your Event or Launch tool in your Dashboard.
		<br/><br/>
		Keep adding details until you are satisfied with how your event looks in Preview before you publish it. Once your event is published on your Showcase you can edit it and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button (though we recommend using this feature sparingly, as you might confuse your audience).
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your event using the Email and Share functions. Encourage members to give feedback using Reviews, Craves and Ratings. This will help you plan your next event. If a member craves an event of yours they will automatically be notified about your future Events, Launches and Upcoming projects or events and if your event features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		To aid event administration we will send you a list of attendees. We offer members who obtain tickets for your event through us the option of meeting up at the venue using our Meeting Point App. You can see who has chosen to use our Meeting Point App by clicking on the button in your administration section. 
		<br/><br/>
		Once your Launch is over, you can add images of the occasion on your Showcase. If you have purchased an Event with Launch, these images will also appear on the Event page acting as a great introduction to the Ongoing Event.
		<br/><br/>
		If you’re not a performer, you can engage in the world of What’s On and circulate the buzz via Event Notifications. With this free tool you act as the town crier and let people know what’s happening and where. With an Event, the old adage ‘The More the Merrier’ always applies.  So grow your audience…
