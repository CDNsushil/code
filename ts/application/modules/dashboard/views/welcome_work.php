		Here is your on-line job centre, employment notice-board and directory of talent.
		<br/><br/>
		Both sides of the employment market in the creative industries meet here. Whether it is Work Offered, Work Wanted, Work Experience opportunities available or Work Experience Wanted, you can monitor – and join - the dynamic two-way traffic that keeps the world of work turning around.
		<br/><br/>
		Do you need a make-up artist or an actress for your commercial?  Are you looking for a full-time job? A part-time role? A secondary income? Let’s see what’s out there.
		<br/><br/>
		First, buy your Work tool. Fill in the short forms in the administration section and advertise. Before you put up your advert, check it out in Preview and make sure it is as attractive and as clear in its specifications as possible. Remember to publicise your classified using the Email and Share functions.
		<br/><br/>
		Sit back and see how many Craves you get. In this section, Craves work like a reminder list, letting people create a record or wish-list of what work they would like to apply for or who they would like to work with. This is the only section in which Craves are private - to allow you to look for work or new colleagues and associates without jeopardising a current work situation. If your classified features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		The business of employment is stressful, but Toadsquare cuts down the nebulous nature of looking for work or for people to collaborate with by enabling you to keep track of the applications you send or receive.  
		<br/><br/>
		Use Work Profile to further streamline the work application process.  If you are looking for work, this will let you send out your multimedia CV as part of an application. If you are hiring, it also helps you decide whom you want to work with as you have access to see and assess the quality of an applicant’s work.
