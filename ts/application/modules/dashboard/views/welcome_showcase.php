		This is your own mini website, the centre of your online universe, and the stage on which you show the world what you have to offer.
		<br/><br/>
		To launch your Showcase, you first need to fill in some basic details and publish your Showcase Homepage. 
		<br/><br/>
		Once you have published this introductory section, you can use the other sections in Showcase and start to define, display and promote your business as you would like it to be seen. People will now be able to find you through our search facility.  Excitingly, search engines such as Google will also start to find you.
		<br/><br/>
		The more effort you put into creating and updating your Showcase Homepage, the better you’ll look online. You can add details as your interests develop, your portfolio expands and your career evolves. The possibilities are limitless. 
		<br/><br/>
		This section serves to link the rest of your Showcase sections - so make sure you update the default image, complete the About Me section and ask colleagues to recommend you. If you have positive PR pieces to add, so much the better. You can also show off your versatility and attract more visitors to your Showcase by putting up a second or third Showcase Homepage in different languages.
		<br/><br/>
		After you have published your Homepage, check out your Dashboard and see what else you have available in your free membership.  You may wish to tell your friends and contacts about your new Homepage using our Email and Share functions. Our Tips pages will help you consider how best to use Toadsquare’s many features.
		<br/><br/>
		Creative endeavours benefit from feedback and you can gauge responses to your work in this section through Reviews and Recommendations, Ratings and Craves. It is the ultimate compliment when a member craves your Showcase Homepage: it means they want to be notified about all your activities on Toadsquare. 
		<br/><br/>
		If your Showcase Homepage features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		So take control of your distinctive creative personality. Launch yourself, show off your work and enjoy looking good!
