		Promote and sell your Photography and Art in a stunning online gallery.
		<br/><br/>
		Toadsquare makes it simple for you to present your work in its best light.  Upload your images to your Showcase and people will be able to appreciate your creative work and learn more about its back story and development path.
		<br/><br/>
		Use the Oneline description to introduce your album. If you want to engage people at a deeper level, you have up to 600 words to use in Further Description to enhance the overall presentation of your project.
		<br/><br/>
		Our site gives you feedback through Reviews, Craves and Ratings. If a member craves your work they will automatically be notified about similar work you do and Upcoming projects or events you put up. If your album features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		To get started: select a Media tool and decide how much space your album will need. You get 50 MB of free space, but some projects will need more.  You can always add extra space to an album from your Dashboard. 
		<br/><br/>
		Next, fill in the Photography & Art New Project Wizard and save. There is a lot of information you can add here, but you can do so in stages. You only have to fill in the basic information on the Description Page to first save the project.  
		<br/><br/>
		If you choose to sell your album, each image will have a watermark. If you choose to make the album free, no image will have a watermark. If you change your mind, the watermark setting will not automatically change. You have to reload your images to add or remove their watermarks.
		<br/><br/>
		After saving the project, you can add details until you are satisfied with how your work looks in Preview before you publish it. Once your album is published on your Showcase, you can edit it, and even take it down temporarily using the Hide button.
		<br/><br/>
		It’s also the place to start earning some extra money. Photography & Art allows you to publish and distribute your own work. You can choose how you want to deliver your work: via Download or as a shipped Product. If you don’t want to sell your work, you can ask people to Donate to show appreciation of it.
		<br/><br/>
		You can invite members you have included in Key Personnel to Show an album or image on their own Showcases. Putting a link to your work on other members’ Showcases gives fans and casual visitors more of an opportunity to find your work.
		<br/><br/>
		Remember to publicise your work using the Email and Share functions.  If you know of other media projects on Toadsquare associated with yours, you can connect to them in Supporting Media and in PR Material you can add links to News, Reviews and Interviews. 
		<br/><br/>
		Go on! See how many people will crave your work…
