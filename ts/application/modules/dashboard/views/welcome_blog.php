		Establish yourself as a unique voice in your creative field. 
		<br/><br/>
		Writing a blog on Toadsquare is amazingly simple - and it’s free.  You have 50 MB of space to add your views and opinions to the free-flow of ideas, big and small, around the world. You can use your blog as a channel to foster ideas, start a conversation, link specialist interests, find kindred spirits and generate feedback.
		<br/><br/>
		If you become addicted to the art of the blogging and exceed your complimentary 50MB, you can always buy more space or delete early posts.
		<br/><br/>
		You will notice there are no comments on our blogs. Instead, if someone’s post inspires you, you can Respond.  Start a debate!  Then see what other members think by monitoring the various Ratings and Craves your blog receives. If your blog features in the Top Craved list, it will be advertised on our Landing Page Banner.
		<br/><br/>
		If you want your opinion to reach a wider audience faster and you want to assess global opinion through your Ratings and Craves, broadcast your blog or a particular post using Email and Share. Members can follow your blog through the RSS feed or by craving it. If they crave your blog, they will be notified whenever you post.
		<br/><br/>
		To start blogging, you need to add a short introduction to your post in Blog Settings. Once saved, you can start writing and put up your first contribution to the word on the wires. To make your blog even more engaging and to add a different pace, you can add your Twitter feed here too. And if you like to post when you’re out and about, you can preload images in your Media Gallery.
		<br/><br/>
		You are now ready to enter the addictive world of blogging…
