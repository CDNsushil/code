		Keep your presentation-ready portfolio in your pocket.
		<br/><br/>
		Members of the creative industries face a unique challenge when selling themselves and their work: describing a creative project never does it justice.
		<br/><br/>
		Our Work Profile solves this problem.  It links your CV to your media gallery, giving potential colleagues and employers a visceral experience of your work.
		<br/><br/>
		Set up your Work Profile and you have a multimedia CV that can be shown off online or on a tablet or a smartphone using our Work Profile App (available for android or Apple devices).
		<br/><br/>
		First, buy the Work Profile tool, and then keep adding information in the administration section until you are satisfied with how you look online, on smartphone, on tablet and in print.
		<br/><br/>
		The only tricky thing to remember is that Recommendations are managed from your Showcase Homepage, so you need to add them to your Work Profile from your Showcase Homepage administration section.
		<br/><br/>
		If you email someone a link to your Work Profile they will have access to your online CV for 21 days. Members can request a link to your Work Profile from your Showcase; you can choose to add it to a Work Application; or you can email it out.  
		<br/><br/>
		If you’re in a café or in the company of a potential employer or new colleague, you can pull out your tablet or smartphone and show off your portfolio - even if you are offline.
